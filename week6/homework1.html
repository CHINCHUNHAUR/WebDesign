                <p>My name is Miles Morales. I was bitten by a radioactive spider. And for like two days, I've been the
                    one and only Spider-Man. I think you know the rest. I finished my essay. Saved a bunch of people.
                    Got hit by a drone. I did this with my dad. Met my roommate. Finally. Slapped a sticker where my
                    dad's never gonna find it. And when I feel alone, like no one understands what I'm going through, I
                    remember my friends who get it. I never thought I'd be able to do any of this stuff. But I can.
                    Anyone can wear the mask. You could wear the mask. If you didn't know that before, I hope you do
                    now. 'Cause I'm Spider-Man.</p>

                <p> All right, let's do this one last time. My name is Peter Parker. I was bitten by a radioactive
                    spider, and for ten years I've been the one and only Spider-Man. I'm pretty sure you know the rest.
                    I saved a bunch of people, fell in love, saved the city, and then I saved the city again... and
                    again and again and again.</p>
