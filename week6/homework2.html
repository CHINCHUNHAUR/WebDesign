                <p>After advancing to the final round, Michinaga joined Ace Ukiyo and Takeshi Goutokuji as one of the
                    three remaining competitors. Alongside Shirowe, he transforms into Buffa and is deployed the city.
                    After witnessing Goutokuji save them, Michinaga accused him of saving Keiwa Sakurai and Neon Kurama
                    to score extra points. When Goutokuji was instantly killed by the Slug Fortress Jyamato, Michinaga
                    laughed since it meant he had one less obstacle to overcome. To Michinaga's disapproval, Ace showed
                    up and defeated the last boss, ending Michinaga's chances of victory.In the new world, Michinaga
                    lost all of his memories. As the next edition of the DGP began, Michinaga accepted Tsumuri's
                    invitation to participate in the new tournament, restoring his memories as Kamen Rider Buffa in the
                    process. He would also meet with Keiwa and Neon again, though initially doubting their odds of
                    survival. During the Treasure Hunting mission of the competition, Michinaga would acquire the Zombie
                    Raise Buckle again, but is forced to relinquish it after losing a bet with Ace during the Zombie
                    Hunting mission. He also forms a temporary truce with Kanato Sumida in exchange for the Magnum
                    Buckle, before Kanato himself was eliminated from the tournament.</p>

                <p>When Michinaga Azuma was in high school, he and his best friend Toru Imai fought a group of bullies
                    before they were taken in by a "boss". At some point later in their adulthood, they became
                    construction workers. However, Toru became a contestant of the Desire Grand Prix where he was killed
                    by two enemy Kamen Riders. After Toru died in Michinaga's arms, Michinaga was saved by Ace Ukiyo,
                    who rescued him from two Jyamato. Michinaga was later knocked unconscious by Desire Grand Prix staff
                    and taken away..</p>
